# Folder_Lock_In_Java

Project Title: Folder Locker Software Using Java Project.

Project Description: This application is developed using the Java-17 version. There we have used standard libraries such as AWT, IO, and SWING. This software is designed to provide an extra layer of security to essential files and folders in a computer. When I lock any folder for security, I must enter a valid password and confirm it. If both fields do not match, an error message will show and be highlighted with the red mark. When I try to open this folder, the folder shows empty. This software also includes a system tray icon that appears at the right-bottom side when the software is running. During unlock, when I enter the valid passcode, I will be directed inside the folder. There is also an option to remove the password. Given the old correct passcode, I will be able to remove the passcode successfully.

Technologies Used: Core Java
